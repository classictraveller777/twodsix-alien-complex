# twodsix-alien-complex

This module is designed for use with the Foundry VTT [Twodsix game system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/twodsix/)

This module contains scenes, actors, macros so that the GM can 'fill in the blanks' and design an adventure for players to investigate a pyramid complex. ( as per the ancient aliens meme I'm not saying it was aliens.. but it was aliens. ) 
      
NOTE this module is not a 100% ready to run adventure out of the box. 

The module is customisable in that the GM can replace existing tiles and actors, and flesh out existing scene locations with animal encounters and / or draw additional images onto scene locations. ( For this the GM has to have access to drawing tools such as photoshop or gimp and asset images to place on tiles or the scene background )

[Twodsix system configuration guide](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/System-Configuration-Guide).   
The included sample actors ( for players and animals ) have been pre-configured for use with the cepheus light ruleset. The GM can reconfigure the module to use one of the rule systems supported by the Twodsix module.

The intent of this module, is to provide the basis for GM's new to Foundry and Twodsix, to be able to run a short, small scale adventure to learn and build skills and confidence with Foundry VTT, as did I the module author, through developing this module, with the help and support of others in the Foundry community ( the official Foundry and Twodsix discords, the [Foundry subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Foundry), the [Foundry wiki](https://foundryvtt.wiki/) etc ). 

By design I limited the use of 3rd party modules to a minimum to help both myself, and others starting out that want to use this module. For example whilst I did use the [Levels](https://wiki.theripper93.com/levels) module to model ventilation shafts on a scene the trade off is that this adds additional complexity for GMs new to Foundry.


Installation instructions. 

1. Install the twodsix game system in Foundry
2. Install the twodsix-alien-complex module in Foundry using the manifest url  https://github.com/classictraveller777/twodsix-alien-complex/releases/latest/download/module.json
3. Create a new empty world and select twodsix as the rules set. NOTE I suggest the GM not put alien-complex in the world name so players will not know what the adventure is
4. Launch the new empty world 
5. From the game setup menu click on manage modules and check the box for the twodsix-alien-complex in the module management dialog 
6. Wait for the world to refresh
7. From the compendium menu click the twodsix alien complex compendium
8. From the open compendium click the twodsix alien complex 
9. Click the import adventure button on the adventure: twodsix-alien-complex dialog 
10. Read the GM only journal entries and become familiar with the complex and links between scenes. 
11. Edit the scenes, actors etc to flesh out and setup a ready to run adventure. 

NOTE Foundry will install the latest version of all module dependencies ( for e.g. levels, monks active tiles etc ). For this reason it is necessary that the GM prep the adventure and play test the scenes and run tokens through the levels, test out the scene teleports and macros etc. ( for example the levels module may have issues with fog of war for players that change levels within a scene, for more information refer GM journal notes on scenes. )    
NOTE that the Twodsix module will install using the default settings, including the UI blue on black default UI theme /style. I suggest the GM configure the Twodsix module display settings to use the Foundry standard style as the blue text on black background can be hard to read clearly, especially if editing tiles to be able to read what the tile actions / triggers are.
